# PageRank Algorithm Implementation

**Semester Project** — Data Structures & Algorithms

---

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of the **PageRank algorithm** as described in the research paper “*The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine*” by *Sergey Brin, Lawrence Page*.

During this semester project, the focus was on:

- Understanding the mathematical foundation of PageRank (transition matrices, damping factor, convergence)  
- Implementing the algorithm from scratch in Java
